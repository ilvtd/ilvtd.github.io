					<p>
						Eye Spy is a mobile app that tracks users and gives "achievements" for doing a wide variety of things. The aim of Eye Spy to make users aware of how much of their information can be easily collected through the everyday things they do with their phone.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To create a sense of engagement and reward different types of tracking can be unlocked. They will start off with only being tracked through geolocation but as they receive "achievements" in this category, they will unlock others. What starts out as minor tracking will quickly turn into mass surveillance.
					</p>

					<p>
						To protect userâ€™s privacy, the information gathered through Eye Spy will only be used to give achievements.
