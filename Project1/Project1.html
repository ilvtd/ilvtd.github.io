					<h3>About</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>
						Eye Spy is a mobile app that tracks users and gives "achievements" for doing a wide variety of things. The aim of Eye Spy to make users aware of the information that can be collected by other apps through the everyday usage of their phone.

						<h3>Achievements</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							There will be a wide range of categories and achievements. Achievements will include things like; going to a certain place, turning on/off their phone, or receiving a text message with a certain phrase.
						</p>
						<p>
							The achievement categories will include things like; geolocation, text messages, microphone and camera.
						</p>
						<p>
							To create a sense of engagement and reward for users, the different categories of achievements can be unlocked. Users will start off only being tracked through geolocation but as they receive "achievements" in this category, they will unlock other more achievements in other categories. What starts out as minor tracking will quickly turn into mass surveillance.
						</p>
						<p>
							To protect user’s privacy, the information gathered through Eye Spy will only be used to give achievements.

					<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				</div>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							The target audience of Eye Spy is anyone who wants to become more aware of and learn more about the ways their phone and the apps on it could be tracking them or collecting personal information.

						<h3>Notifications</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							Users can choose to receive notifications whenever they get a new achievement.
						</p>
