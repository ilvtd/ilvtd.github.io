					<h3>About</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>
						Eye Spy is a mobile app that tracks users and gives "achievements" for doing a wide variety of things. The aim of Eye Spy to make users aware of how much of their information can be easily collected through the everyday things they do with their phone.
					</p>
					<p>
						To protect user’s privacy, the information gathered through Eye Spy will only be used to give achievements.

				<h3>Achievements</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>
				 	There will be a wide range of achievements and categories for achievements available. These will include achievements like going to a certain place, turning on/off their phone, or receiving a text message with a certain phrase.
				</p>
				<p>
				 	The achievement categories will include things like geolocation, text messages, microphone and camera.
				</p>
				<p>
					To create a sense of engagement and reward for users, different types of achievements can be unlocked. They will start off with only being tracked through geolocation but as they receive "achievements" in this category, they will unlock others. What starts out as minor tracking will quickly turn into mass surveillance.

				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>
						The target audience of Eye Spy is anyone who wants to learn more about how their phone and apps could be tracking them or collecting personal information.

				</div>
				<div class="item">
				<div class="black">
					<h3>Notifications</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>
						Users can choose to receive notifications whenever they get a new achievement. Receiving a notification will remind users that their phone and the apps on it are tracking them and what they’re doing.
					</p>
					<p>	
						Notifications also mean users don’t have to open the app to find out if they have received any new achievements.
